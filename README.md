## 💻 **First Ideathon Proposal**  

I created **CareerBuddy** as an idea and a prototype for my first hackathon 🎉. The project aims to solve real-world challenges like isolation in career planning and lack of access to like-minded peers. During the hackathon, I focused on:  

- 🌟 **Designing the user flow**: Making it simple and intuitive for users to connect and collaborate.  
- 💻 **Prototyping core features**: From AI-powered matchmaking to real-time note-sharing, the prototype highlights the key functionalities of the platform.  
- 🌍 **Bringing a global community together**: Building a space where geography doesn’t limit learning or growth.
